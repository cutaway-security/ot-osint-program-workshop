  <h2>Remediation Prioritization Recap</h2>

  <p>Throughout this workshop, you used the P0-P3 framework to prioritize findings by operational impact. This hierarchy applies to every artifact you built today and every finding your monitoring program surfaces going forward:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Priority</th>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Response</th>
        <th>Example</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>P0 -- Active Exploitation</strong></td>
        <td>Direct exposure + confirmed active exploitation (CISA KEV, CISA ICS advisory, or vendor alert) + safety or operational impact</td>
        <td>Immediate action (hours, not days)</td>
        <td>FortiGate CVE-2025-59718 on an internet-facing admin interface with active exploitation confirmed by CISA KEV and Fortinet PSIRT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>P1 -- Critical</strong></td>
        <td>Direct exposure + known exploit + safety or operational impact</td>
        <td>Investigate within 24 hours</td>
        <td>Internet-exposed remote access portal running a product version with a published exploit, but no confirmed active exploitation from CISA or vendor sources</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>P2 -- Urgent</strong></td>
        <td>Remote access exposure + credential risk, or vulnerable edge device without confirmed exploitation</td>
        <td>Remediate within 1-2 weeks</td>
        <td>Tier 1 personnel credentials in a recent breach, or a known-vulnerable edge device not yet in CISA KEV</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>P3 -- Planned</strong></td>
        <td>Information disclosure, configuration weaknesses, monitoring gaps</td>
        <td>Remediate within 30-90 days</td>
        <td>Excessive DNS information disclosure, stale subdomains, personnel with outdated professional profiles exposing technology details</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>The baseline and monitoring program give you the <strong>visibility</strong> to apply this framework consistently. Without them, prioritization is guesswork.</p>

  <h2>What You Are Leaving With (8 Artifacts)</h2>

  <p>Each artifact builds on the ones before it. Together, they form a complete OT OSINT monitoring program -- from understanding the threat landscape to operationalizing the monitoring process.</p>

  <p>These artifacts are not independent documents -- they are a connected system. The threat profile (1) tells you what to look for. The inventories (2-4) tell you what you have and where you are exposed. The monitoring infrastructure (5-6) watches for changes. The baseline (7) gives you a reference point. The runbook (8) keeps it all running.</p>

  <h2>Next Steps Beyond This Workshop</h2>

  <p>The program you built today is a foundation. These are the logical next steps, ordered by the value they add to the monitoring program:</p>

  <h3>Response Playbooks</h3>

  <p>Your runbook defines routine operations -- what to check and when. Playbooks define what to do when monitoring surfaces a specific finding type. Start with playbooks for your highest-impact scenarios:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Exposed remote access:</strong> A new VPN portal or admin interface appears in Shodan/Censys that is not in your baseline</li>
    <li><strong>Breached credentials:</strong> A Tier 1 or Tier 2 employee appears in a new breach with password or hash exposure</li>
    <li><strong>Critical vulnerability on exposed asset:</strong> A P0 or P1 finding from your vulnerability correlation workflow -- active exploitation confirmed by CISA KEV, CISA ICS advisory, or vendor PSIRT on an internet-facing edge device</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each playbook should define: who is notified, what immediate containment actions are taken, how the finding is validated, and how remediation is tracked to resolution.</p>

  <h3>Tabletop Exercises</h3>

  <p>Validate your playbooks before a real incident. Walk through scenarios using your actual artifacts: "The Monday morning KEV review shows CVE-2026-XXXXX added for FortiGate FortiOS 7.4.x. Your baseline shows two internet-facing FortiGate instances. Walk through your response." Tabletop exercises expose gaps in escalation paths, unclear ownership, and missing tool access before they matter.</p>

  <h3>Script Automation</h3>

  <p>The same AI clients you used throughout this workshop can generate scripts that automate your pull-based checks. Candidates for automation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>crt.sh API queries with diff against baseline subdomain list</li>
    <li>CISA KEV JSON feed parsing with match against your asset inventory CPEs</li>
    <li>Shodan API queries for monitored IP ranges with change detection</li>
    <li>HIBP API lookups for domain-level breach monitoring (requires API key)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Start with the [CORE] procedures from your runbook -- these are the checks that run no matter what, so they benefit most from automation.</p>

  <h3>Program Maturity</h3>

  <p>As the program matures, build toward:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Track alerts received vs. actionable findings, triage response time, baseline changes per cycle, and open remediation aging. These demonstrate program value and identify where effort is wasted</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder reporting:</strong> Quarterly briefings for management using the P0-P3 framework to frame findings and remediation progress</li>
    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Connect monitoring outputs to existing vulnerability management, change management, and incident response workflows</li>
    <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Add new monitoring targets as the organization's OT footprint changes -- new facilities, new vendors, new remote access technologies</li>
  </ul>
