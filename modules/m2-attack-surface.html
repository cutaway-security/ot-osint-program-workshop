<section class="module-overview">
  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Your external attack surface is everything an adversary can see about your organization <strong>without authenticating</strong> -- domains, subdomains, login portals, exposed services, and the technologies behind them. In Module 1, we established that publicly discoverable information enabled every attack we reviewed. This module teaches you how to discover that information systematically, the same way an adversary would.</p>

  <h3>What Adversaries See</h3>

  <p>External reconnaissance requires no credentials and no special access. An adversary with a web browser and free tools can discover:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Domains and subdomains</strong> -- every registered domain and SSL certificate your organization has issued reveals infrastructure</li>
    <li><strong>Login portals</strong> -- VPN, webmail, remote desktop, and application login pages are visible to anyone who finds them</li>
    <li><strong>Technology stack</strong> -- HTTP headers, certificate details, and login page appearance reveal specific products and versions</li>
    <li><strong>Development and staging environments</strong> -- subdomains like dev., staging., or test. often have weaker security controls</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Discovery Techniques</h3>

  <p>This module uses four complementary techniques, all browser-based:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Technique</th>
        <th>What It Finds</th>

  </table>

  <h3>Naming Conventions That Reveal Infrastructure</h3>

  <p>Organizations often use predictable subdomain naming patterns. These are valuable reconnaissance targets because they indicate what is behind each service:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Pattern</th>
        <th>What It Suggests</th>

        <td>Virtual desktop / remote desktop services</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>mail., owa., webmail.</td>
        <td>Email services (login portals)</td>
      </tr>

  <h2>Worked Example: NRECA Domain Discovery</h2>

  <p>We will walk through external attack surface discovery for NRECA (National Rural Electric Cooperative Association) using publicly available tools. This demonstrates the complete workflow you will replicate for your own organization in the lab.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Certificate Transparency Search</h3>

  <p>Certificate transparency (CT) logs record every SSL/TLS certificate issued by public certificate authorities. When an organization requests a certificate for a subdomain, that subdomain becomes permanently recorded in CT logs -- even if the subdomain is not linked from any public page.</p>

  <p><strong>1a. Query the crt.sh JSON API</strong></p>

  <p>crt.sh provides a JSON API that returns structured certificate data. Appending <code>&amp;output=json</code> to any crt.sh query returns JSON instead of an HTML table -- this makes it easy to feed results directly to your AI client for analysis.</p>

  <p>Visit the JSON endpoint for electric.coop:</p>

  <p><a href="https://crt.sh/?q=%25.electric.coop&output=json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://crt.sh/?q=%25.electric.coop&amp;output=json</a></p>

  <p>Save the JSON response to a local file using your browser's Save Page As (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S). Name it something descriptive like <code>electric_coop_crt.json</code>.</p>

  <p><strong>1b. AI-assisted CT analysis</strong></p>

  <p>Attach or paste the saved JSON file into your AI client with this prompt:</p>

{% capture m2_ct_prompt %}
I am analyzing certificate transparency data from crt.sh for an
electric cooperative organization. The attached/pasted JSON contains
certificate records for %.electric.coop.

Analyze this data and provide:
1. A deduplicated list of all unique subdomain and domain names
2. Naming patterns and conventions the organization uses
3. Subdomains suggesting admin interfaces, login portals,
   VPN/remote access, dev/staging environments, or API endpoints
4. Any wildcard certificates and what infrastructure they might
   cover
5. Certificate authorities used (this can reveal vendor
   relationships and hosting providers)
6. Anything unusual or potentially sensitive that a human reviewer
   would miss scrolling through hundreds of certificate rows

Output a clean categorized subdomain list organized by
function/risk category.
{% endcapture %}
{% include prompt-block.html title="CT JSON Analysis Prompt" content=m2_ct_prompt %}

  <p><strong>Timeout fallback:</strong> crt.sh JSON responses can be slow for domains with large result sets. If the endpoint times out or returns an error, use the standard HTML view at <a href="https://crt.sh/?q=%25.electric.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crt.sh/?q=%25.electric.coop</a>, select all results in the table (Ctrl+A), copy (Ctrl+C), and paste into your AI client instead.</p>

<h4>Certificate Transparency Analysis: electric.coop</h4>

<p><strong>Unique Domains/Subdomains (deduplicated):</strong></p>

<p><strong>Public-Facing / Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>electric.coop -- primary public website</li>
  <li>www.electric.coop -- www redirect</li>
  <li>remagazine.cooperative.com -- RE Magazine content platform</li>
  <li>careers.electric.coop -- job postings and recruitment</li>
  <li>nrecainternational.coop -- international programs site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Member/Employee Portals (Login Required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>cooperative.com -- member portal (SharePoint-based)</li>
  <li>benefits.cooperative.com -- employee benefits enrollment</li>
  <li>resap.cooperative.com -- Rural Electric Safety Achievement Program</li>
  <li>ecba.cooperative.com -- Electric Cooperative Bar Association</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Email / Communication:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>nreca.coop -- email domain (confirmed format: firstname.lastname@nreca.coop)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Naming Patterns Identified:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Program-specific subdomains under cooperative.com (benefits, resap, ecba) -- suggests each internal program gets its own subdomain</li>
  <li>Public content uses electric.coop; internal/member services use cooperative.com -- clear split between public and authenticated surfaces</li>
  <li>Email on a separate domain (nreca.coop) from web properties</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Wildcard Certificates:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>*.cooperative.com -- covers all subdomains under cooperative.com. This means additional subdomains may exist that are not individually logged in CT. Consider DNS enumeration tools to find subdomains covered by this wildcard.</li>
  <li>*.electric.coop -- same pattern; additional subdomains may be hidden behind the wildcard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Certificate Authorities Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>DigiCert -- used for primary domains, suggests enterprise certificate management</li>
  <li>Let's Encrypt -- used for some subdomains, may indicate cloud-hosted or developer-managed services</li>
  <li>Sectigo -- used for specific portals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notable Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The wildcard certificates for *.cooperative.com and *.electric.coop mean the CT logs undercount the actual subdomain footprint. DNS enumeration (DNSDumpster, SecurityTrails) should be used to find subdomains covered by these wildcards.</li>
  <li>The split between DigiCert (enterprise) and Let's Encrypt (free/automated) may indicate some services are managed outside the primary IT team -- worth investigating for shadow IT.</li>
  <li>Benefits portal (benefits.cooperative.com) is a high-value target -- benefits systems typically contain SSNs, banking details, and salary data.</li>
</ul>

</details>

  <h3>Step 2: Subdomain Enumeration Across All Root Domains</h3>

  <p>CT logs from Step 1 reveal certificate-level data, but comprehensive discovery requires <strong>subdomain enumeration across every root domain</strong> the organization uses. NRECA operates across at least three root domains: <strong>electric.coop</strong> (public website), <strong>cooperative.com</strong> (member services), and <strong>nreca.coop</strong> (email). Each reveals different infrastructure -- and the most "obvious" domain often reveals the least.</p>

  <p><strong>2a. Enumerate subdomains with Subdomain Finder</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subdomainfinder.c99.nl</a> is a subdomain enumeration tool that aggregates results from multiple sources and exports JSON. Search each of NRECA's root domains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Search <strong>cooperative.com</strong>: <a href="https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subdomainfinder.c99.nl</a> -- this returns 100+ subdomains with rich infrastructure detail</li>
    <li>Search <strong>electric.coop</strong>: same tool -- this returns only ~2 subdomains (www, careers)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The contrast is the key lesson: <strong>the public-facing website domain (electric.coop) reveals almost nothing, while the member-services domain (cooperative.com) exposes the entire internal infrastructure</strong>. An adversary who only searches the primary website domain misses most of the attack surface -- and so will a defender who does the same.</p>

  <p>Save the JSON results for each domain. Results pages follow the pattern <code>subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/YYYY-MM-DD/domain.com</code>. Use your browser's Save Page As (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S) to save each result set. The JSON structure contains objects with subdomain, IP address, and Cloudflare status:</p>

  <pre><code>{"subdomain":"okta.cooperative.com","ip":"15.197.134.95","cloudflare":"false"}</code></pre>

  <p><strong>2b. AI-assisted subdomain analysis</strong></p>

  <p>Attach or paste the saved JSON files from all enumerated domains into your AI client with this prompt:</p>

{% capture m2_subdomain_prompt %}
I am analyzing subdomain enumeration data for an electric
cooperative association (NRECA). The attached/pasted JSON files
contain subdomain records for cooperative.com and electric.coop.
Each record includes subdomain name, IP address, and Cloudflare
status.

Analyze the combined data and provide:
1. All unique subdomains grouped by root domain
2. IP address clustering -- which subdomains share the same IP
   (suggests shared hosting or load balancer)
3. Authentication and identity infrastructure (SSO portals,
   federation servers, access management)
4. Remote access or VPN-related subdomains
5. API endpoints and what backend systems they suggest
6. Staging, test, or development environments
7. Blue/green or canary deployment patterns that reveal
   infrastructure architecture
8. Subdomains revealing sensitive business functions (benefits,
   payroll, financial, compliance, HR)
9. Which subdomains use cloud provider IPs vs on-premise IP
   ranges
10. Which root domain reveals the most infrastructure detail
    and why that matters for reconnaissance

Output a categorized inventory organized by: authentication/
identity, remote access, benefits/HR, financial/compliance,
APIs/backend, staging/test, content/public, and other.

<details>
  <summary>Example AI Response (Subdomain Analysis for NRECA)</summary>
{% capture m2_subdomain_response %}
<h4>Subdomain Enumeration Analysis: NRECA</h4>

<p><strong>Domain Contrast:</strong> electric.coop returned only 2 subdomains (www.electric.coop, careers.electric.coop). cooperative.com returned 100+ subdomains exposing authentication infrastructure, benefits systems, financial portals, APIs, and staging environments. The member-facing domain is far richer for reconnaissance than the public website.</p>

<p><strong>Authentication / Identity:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>okta.cooperative.com</strong> -- Okta SSO portal. Reveals the organization uses Okta as its identity provider. High-value target: compromising SSO provides access to all federated applications.</li>
  <li><strong>pingfed.cooperative.com</strong> -- PingFederate identity federation server. Indicates a dual-IdP architecture (Okta + Ping) or migration between platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>pingaccess.cooperative.com</strong> -- PingAccess API security gateway. Controls access to web applications and APIs behind the Ping identity stack.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits / HR (High-Value PII Targets):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>benefits.cooperative.com</strong> -- primary benefits portal</li>
  <li><strong>beneficiaries.cooperative.com</strong> -- beneficiary designation (life insurance, retirement accounts)</li>
  <li><strong>cobra.cooperative.com</strong> -- COBRA benefits continuation</li>
  <li><strong>divorce.cooperative.com</strong>, <strong>marriage.cooperative.com</strong>, <strong>newchild.cooperative.com</strong> -- life event processing portals (contain highly sensitive personal data)</li>
  <li><strong>w2salary.cooperative.com</strong> -- W-2 and salary data (tax documents, compensation)</li>
  <li><strong>retirement.cooperative.com</strong> -- retirement/pension management</li>
</ul>
<p>This cluster represents a massive PII exposure surface. Benefits systems typically contain SSNs, banking details, salary data, and family information. Each subdomain is a potential credential stuffing target.</p>

<p><strong>Financial / Compliance:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>form990.cooperative.com</strong> -- IRS Form 990 (nonprofit tax filings, reveals financial data)</li>
  <li><strong>financialpower.cooperative.com</strong> -- financial services portal</li>
  <li><strong>invoicepreferences.cooperative.com</strong> -- invoice management (potential for business email compromise targeting)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>APIs / Backend:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple *api.* subdomains revealing backend service architecture</li>
  <li>API endpoints suggest microservices architecture with dedicated backends for member services, content delivery, and internal tooling</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Staging / Test (Often Less Secured):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>stage.cooperative.com</strong>, <strong>stagesearch.cooperative.com</strong> -- staging environment</li>
  <li><strong>test.community.cooperative.com</strong> -- test instance of community platform</li>
  <li><strong>pae-ext-test.cooperative.com</strong>, <strong>pfe-ext-test.cooperative.com</strong> -- external test instances of PingAccess and PingFederate (identity infrastructure test environments are especially sensitive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Staging and test environments frequently have weaker authentication, default credentials, or disabled security controls. Identity infrastructure test instances (pae-ext-test, pfe-ext-test) are high-priority findings.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure Architecture:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Blue/green deployment:</strong> Extensive blue.* subdomain pattern (blue.benefits, blue.retirement, etc.) reveals blue/green deployment architecture. This tells an adversary how the organization manages releases and where redundant infrastructure exists.</li>
  <li><strong>IP clustering:</strong> The majority of cooperative.com subdomains resolve to 74.127.88.162, suggesting centralized hosting or a load balancer fronting most services. A small number of subdomains resolve to different IPs, indicating cloud-hosted or externally managed services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Content / Public:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>electric.coop -- public website, WordPress</li>
  <li>careers.electric.coop -- job postings</li>
  <li>remagazine.cooperative.com -- RE Magazine</li>
  <li>nrecainternational.coop -- international programs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Searching only electric.coop would have found 2 subdomains. Searching cooperative.com revealed authentication infrastructure, benefits/PII systems, financial portals, staging environments, and deployment architecture. Always enumerate all known root domains.</p>

    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Manual website review found 9 domains. Subdomain enumeration of cooperative.com alone found 100+, including authentication infrastructure (Okta, PingFederate), benefits/PII systems, financial portals, and staging environments that do not appear anywhere on the public website. <strong>Enumeration always finds infrastructure that manual review misses.</strong></p>

  <h3>Step 3: Remote Access Identification</h3>

  <p>Use Shodan or Censys browser search to identify what services are exposed on NRECA's known domains or IP ranges. Look for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web servers</strong> -- identified by HTTP response headers (Server, X-Powered-By)</li>
    <li><strong>Mail servers</strong> -- SMTP, IMAP, Exchange endpoints</li>
    <li><strong>VPN login portals</strong> -- identified by product-specific login pages (FortiGate, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto GlobalProtect)</li>
    <li><strong>Load balancers and CDN endpoints</strong> -- may indicate cloud-hosted infrastructure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For each exposed service, document the product name and version where identifiable. This information feeds directly into vulnerability correlation in Module 4.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: AI-Assisted Analysis</h3>

  <p>Feed your discovery results to your AI client for categorization and gap identification:</p>

{% capture m2_analysis_prompt %}
I performed subdomain enumeration on an electric cooperative
organization and found these subdomains:

- benefits.cooperative.com
- resap.cooperative.com
- ecba.cooperative.com
- careers.electric.coop
- remagazine.cooperative.com

Analyze these subdomains and identify:
1. Which suggest administrative or login interfaces
2. Which might contain sensitive employee/member data
3. What additional subdomains I should look for at a large
   electric utility association
4. Suggested Google dork queries to find additional exposed resources
{% endcapture %}
{% include prompt-block.html title="Subdomain Analysis Prompt" content=m2_analysis_prompt %}

{% capture m2_analysis_response %}
<h4>Subdomain Analysis</h4>

<p><strong>1. Administrative / Login Interfaces:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>benefits.cooperative.com</strong> -- almost certainly requires employee login for benefits enrollment, payroll, and personal information. High-value target for credential stuffing.</li>
  <li><strong>resap.cooperative.com</strong> -- RESAP (Rural Electric Safety Achievement Program) likely requires member cooperative login for safety reporting and program participation.</li>
  <li><strong>ecba.cooperative.com</strong> -- ECBA (Electric Cooperative Bar Association) likely requires member login. Lower sensitivity but still an authentication endpoint.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Sensitive Employee/Member Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>benefits.cooperative.com</strong> -- highest sensitivity. Employee benefits portals typically contain SSNs, salary data, health insurance information, and banking details for direct deposit.</li>
  <li><strong>careers.electric.coop</strong> -- contains job descriptions that reveal internal technology stack, team structure, and hiring priorities. May also expose applicant personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Additional Subdomains to Investigate:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>vpn.*, remote.*, access.* -- remote access portals for staff and member cooperatives</li>
  <li>mail.*, owa.*, webmail.* -- email login interfaces</li>
  <li>api.*, services.* -- application programming interfaces that may expose data</li>
  <li>training.*, learning.*, lms.* -- learning management systems (often contain employee rosters)</li>
  <li>helpdesk.*, support.*, tickets.* -- IT support portals</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Suggested Google Dork Queries:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>site:cooperative.com inurl:login</code> -- find login pages across cooperative.com subdomains</li>
  <li><code>site:electric.coop filetype:pdf "confidential"</code> -- find potentially sensitive documents</li>
  <li><code>site:electric.coop intitle:"index of"</code> -- find directory listings</li>
  <li><code>"electric.coop" "nreca.coop" inurl:vpn OR inurl:remote</code> -- find remote access portals</li>

  <h2>Lab: Build Your External Attack Surface Inventory</h2>

  <p>In this lab, you will discover your target organization's external attack surface using the same techniques demonstrated in the worked example. Follow each step and document your findings -- the output becomes Artifact 2.</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Target Selection</h3>

  <p>Select your target organization for this exercise:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your own organization</strong> (with authorization) -- provides the most operationally relevant results</li>
    <li><strong>NRECA</strong> (practice target) -- use the domains from the worked example to follow along</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Identify the primary domain(s) you will investigate. Most organizations have more than one -- check the main website, email domain, and any known portals.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: AI-Assisted Query Generation</h3>

  <p>Use your AI client to generate discovery queries tailored to your target:</p>

{% capture m2_query_prompt %}
I am performing external attack surface discovery on [organization
name], a [sector] organization. Their primary domain is
[domain.com].

Generate:
1. Certificate transparency search queries for crt.sh
2. Google dork queries to find login pages, exposed documents,
   and directory listings
3. Shodan/Censys search queries to identify their internet-facing
   services
4. A list of subdomain naming patterns I should look for based on
   their sector
{% endcapture %}
{% include prompt-block.html title="Query Generation Prompt" content=m2_query_prompt %}

  <p>Save the generated queries. You will use them in the following steps.</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Domain and Subdomain Enumeration</h3>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Enumerate <strong>all known root domains</strong> for your target organization, not just the primary website. As the NRECA example demonstrated, member portals, internal service domains, and email domains often reveal far more infrastructure than the public website.</p>

  <p><strong>3a. crt.sh with AI analysis:</strong> Query the crt.sh JSON API for each root domain and save the results:</p>

  <p><code>https://crt.sh/?q=%25.yourdomain.com&amp;output=json</code></p>

  <p>Save the JSON to a local file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S), then attach or paste it into your AI client:</p>

{% capture m2_lab_ct_prompt %}
I am analyzing certificate transparency data from crt.sh for
[organization name]. The attached/pasted JSON contains certificate
records for %.[yourdomain.com].

Analyze this data and provide:
1. A deduplicated list of all unique subdomain and domain names
2. Naming patterns and conventions the organization uses
3. Subdomains suggesting admin interfaces, login portals,
   VPN/remote access, dev/staging environments, or API endpoints
4. Any wildcard certificates and what infrastructure they might
   cover
5. Certificate authorities used (reveals vendor relationships)
6. Anything unusual or potentially sensitive

Output a clean categorized subdomain list organized by
function/risk category.
{% endcapture %}
{% include prompt-block.html title="CT JSON Analysis Prompt (Your Organization)" content=m2_lab_ct_prompt %}

  <p>If the JSON endpoint times out, use the standard HTML view at <code>https://crt.sh/?q=%25.yourdomain.com</code>, select all results (Ctrl+A), copy, and paste into your AI client instead.</p>

  <p><strong>3b. Subdomain enumeration:</strong> CT logs reveal certificate-level data but may miss subdomains covered by wildcard certificates. Use enumeration tools to find additional subdomains and collect IP address data. Run each tool against <strong>every known root domain</strong> for your target:</p>

  <p><strong>3c. Combined AI analysis:</strong> Feed the combined JSON results from all domains into your AI client using the Subdomain Enumeration Analysis Prompt from the worked example. The AI will categorize subdomains, identify IP clustering, flag authentication infrastructure, and highlight the most revealing domains.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Remote Access Identification</h3>

  <p>Use internet device search engines to identify exposed services and the technologies behind them:</p>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Tool</th>
        <th>What to Do</th>
        <th>Account Required</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://www.shodan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shodan</a></td>
        <td>Search by domain, hostname, or organization name -- review banners for product identification</td>
        <td>Free tier</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><a href="https://search.censys.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Censys</a></td>
        <td>Search by domain or IP -- review certificates and service details</td>
        <td>Free tier</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>Focus on identifying:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>VPN login portals</strong> -- FortiGate, Cisco ASA/AnyConnect, Palo Alto GlobalProtect, SonicWall</li>
    <li><strong>Remote desktop services</strong> -- RDP, Citrix, VMware Horizon</li>
    <li><strong>Vendor remote support tools</strong> -- TeamViewer, AnyDesk, ConnectWise ScreenConnect</li>
    <li><strong>Web application login pages</strong> -- OWA, SharePoint, custom applications</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For each service, document the vendor, product, and version where identifiable from headers, certificates, or login page appearance. This information is critical for Module 4 (Vulnerability Correlation).</p>

  <h3>Step 5: AI-Assisted Analysis</h3>

  <p>Feed your combined findings back to your AI client for categorization, risk prioritization, and gap identification:</p>

{% capture m2_findings_prompt %}
Here are the results of my external attack surface discovery for
[organization name]:

Domains found: [list your domains]
Subdomains found: [list your subdomains]
Exposed services: [list services with product/version where known]

Analyze these findings and provide:
1. A categorized inventory (remote access, email, web apps, other)
2. Which services represent the highest risk for initial access
3. What gaps in my discovery I should investigate further
4. A summary table I can use as my external attack surface baseline
{% endcapture %}
{% include prompt-block.html title="Findings Analysis Prompt" content=m2_findings_prompt %}

  <p>Review the AI-generated analysis and correct any mischaracterizations. The categorized inventory becomes the foundation of your Artifact 2.</p>

<section class="module-output">
  <h2>Output</h2>
  <p><strong>Artifact 2: External attack surface inventory.</strong> A categorized list of your target organization's domains, subdomains, remote access services, and identified technologies. This inventory feeds directly into Module 3 (identifying which personnel have access to these services), Module 4 (correlating identified products against vulnerability databases), and Module 5 (establishing a monitoring baseline to detect changes).</p>
